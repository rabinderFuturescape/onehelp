### Ticket Statuses

Tickets can have the following statuses:

- **Open**: Newly created tickets that haven't been addressed yet
- **In Progress**: Tickets that are currently being worked on
- **Pending**: Tickets awaiting input from the requester or a third party
- **Resolved**: Tickets where the issue has been fixed
- **Closed**: Tickets that have been completed and verified

### Ticket Priorities

Tickets can be assigned different priority levels:

- **Low**: Minor issues that don't significantly impact operations
- **Medium**: Issues that affect operations but have workarounds
- **High**: Significant issues that impact operations
- **Urgent**: Critical issues that severely impact operations and require immediate attention

## Escalations

Escalations ensure that tickets are properly addressed within appropriate timeframes.

### Understanding Escalation Process

The escalation process automatically routes tickets to higher support tiers if they aren't resolved within defined timeframes. This ensures that:

- No tickets are forgotten
- Critical issues receive appropriate attention
- Service level agreements (SLAs) are met

### Escalation Tiers

Escalation tiers represent different levels of support:

- **Tier 1**: First-line support handling common issues
- **Tier 2**: Specialized support for more complex issues
- **Tier 3**: Expert-level support for the most challenging issues

Each tier has designated staff and response time expectations.

### Escalation Notifications

When a ticket is escalated:

1. The newly assigned agents receive notifications
2. Managers may be notified of higher-tier escalations
3. The ticket history records the escalation event
4. The requester may receive updates about the escalation

## Verifications

Verifications ensure that resolved tickets are properly closed with appropriate evidence and approval.

### Requesting Verification

To request verification for a resolved ticket:

1. Open the ticket with "Resolved" status
2. Click "Request Verification"
3. Provide any necessary notes about the resolution
4. Click "Submit"

### Providing Evidence

When requesting verification, you should provide evidence that the issue has been resolved:

1. Screenshots showing the fixed issue
2. Documentation of the solution
3. Confirmation from the requester
4. Any other relevant proof

### Verification Process

The verification process follows these steps:

1. Agent resolves the ticket and requests verification
2. Verifier reviews the resolution and evidence
3. Verifier either:
   - Approves and closes the ticket
   - Rejects and reopens the ticket with feedback
4. All parties are notified of the verification result

## Canned Responses

Canned responses are pre-written replies that can be used to respond to common questions or issues quickly.

### Using Canned Responses

To use a canned response:

1. When adding a comment to a ticket, click "Canned Responses"
2. Browse or search for the appropriate response
3. Select the response to insert it into your comment
4. Edit the response as needed to personalize it
5. Click "Add Comment" to post

### Creating Custom Responses

1. Go to "Settings" > "Canned Responses"
2. Click "New Response"
3. Fill in the details:
   - Title: Name for the response
   - Content: The response text
   - Category: Group for organizing responses
   - Global: Whether the response is available to all users
4. Click "Save"

## Help Topics

Help topics categorize tickets and help route them to the appropriate support teams.

### Browsing Help Topics

To browse help topics:

1. Go to "Settings" > "Help Topics"
2. View the list of available topics
